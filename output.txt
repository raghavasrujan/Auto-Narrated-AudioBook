Operating systems are an essential part of any computer system. Similarly,
a course on operating systems is an essential part of any computer science
education. This field is undergoing rapid change, as computers are now
prevalent in virtually every arena of day-to-day life—from embedded devices
in automobiles through the most sophisticated planning tools for governments
and multinational firms. Yet the fundamental concepts remain fairly clear, and
it is on these that we base this book.

We wrote this book asa text for an introductory course in operating systems
at the junior or senior undergraduate level or at the first-year graduate level. We
hope that practitioners will also find it useful. It provides a clear description
of the concepts that underlie operating systems. As prerequisites, we assume
that the reader is familiar with basic data structures, computer organization,
and a high-level language, such as C or Java. The hardware topics required
for an understanding of operating systems are covered in Chapter 1. In that
chapter, we also include an overview of the fundamental data structures that are
prevalent in most operating systems. For code examples, we use predominantly
C, with some Java, but the reader can still understand the algorithms without
